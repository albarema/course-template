# Webpage publishing using quarto

This material contains the webpage done with `quarto`, which does not need all plugins used in `MkDocs`, which sometimes can get deprecated and turns out not to be always easy to install on a local computer. If you have a branch called `gh-pages` in your repository, then `quarto deploy gh-pages` will publish your site.

If you want to test the webpage on your computer, you only need to install `quarto` and `pandoc`. To use the `R` commands in this webpage example you need optionally the `R` packages `tidyverse, rmarkdown, knitr, gt`. If you are adding `R markdown` files to the webpage, you will need the related packages of their `R` code to make things work.
