# Webpage using quarto

This material contains the webpage done with `quarto`, which does not need all plugins used in `MkDocs`, which sometimes can get deprecated and turns out not to be always easy to install on a local computer. If you have a branch called `gh-pages` in your repository, then `quarto deploy gh-pages` will publish your site.

You only need to install `quarto` in your computer and - if you want to use the `R` commands in this webpage example - the `R` packages `tidyverse, rmarkdown, knitr, gt`.
